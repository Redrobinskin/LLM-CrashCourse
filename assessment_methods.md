# Assessment Methods

In this course, we will be using quizzes to assess your understanding of the material covered in each module. These quizzes will be conducted at the end of each module.

## Module 1 Quiz

After completing the first module, you will be required to take a quiz to test your understanding of Code-Llama and its features, as well as the process of installing it on a Windows device.

## Module 2 Quiz

Upon completion of the second module, you will take another quiz. This will test your understanding of Auto-gpt, its features, and how to install it on a Windows device. Additionally, you will be tested on how to integrate Auto-gpt with Code-Llama.

Remember, the goal of these quizzes is not just to test your knowledge, but to reinforce what you've learned and ensure you're ready to move on to the next step. Good luck!
