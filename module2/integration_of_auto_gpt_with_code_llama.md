# Integration of Auto-gpt with Code-Llama

In this section, we will learn how to integrate Auto-gpt with Code-Llama. This integration will allow us to use the powerful features of Auto-gpt within the Code-Llama environment.

## Steps to Integrate Auto-gpt with Code-Llama

1. **Import Auto-gpt**: The first step is to import Auto-gpt into your Code-Llama project. You can do this by using the `import` command in your Code-Llama script. Here is an example:

```python
import auto_gpt
```

2. **Initialize Auto-gpt**: After importing Auto-gpt, you need to initialize it. This can be done by creating an instance of the Auto-gpt class. Here is an example:

```python
gpt = auto_gpt.AutoGPT()
```

3. **Use Auto-gpt Functions**: Now that you have an instance of Auto-gpt, you can use its functions within your Code-Llama script. For example, you can use the `generate_text` function to generate text using Auto-gpt. Here is an example:

```python
text = gpt.generate_text("Hello, world!")
print(text)
```

## Practice Task

Now that you have learned how to integrate Auto-gpt with Code-Llama, it's time for you to practice. Your task is to write a Code-Llama script that imports Auto-gpt, initializes it, and uses it to generate some text. You can use the examples above as a guide.

Once you have completed this task, you will have successfully integrated Auto-gpt with Code-Llama. This will allow you to use the powerful features of Auto-gpt within the Code-Llama environment.
